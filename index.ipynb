    "You will be able to:\n",

    "* Create, train, and make predictions with Bagging Classifiers\n",
    "* Create, train, and make predictions with a Random Forest\n",
    "* Understand and explain the concept of bagging as it applies to Ensemble Methods\n",
    "* Understand and explain the Subspace Sampling Method and it's use in Random Forests"
